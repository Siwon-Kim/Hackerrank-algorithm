/*
Kruskal MST Algorithm (Minial Spanning Tree)
: A Spanning tree is a subset to a connected graph G, where all the edges are connected, 
  i.e, one can traverse to any edge from a particular edge with or without intermediates. 
  Also, a spanning tree must not have any cycle in it. 
  Thus we can say that if there are N vertices in a connected graph 
  then the no. of edges that a spanning tree may have is N-1.
  
: Given a connected and undirected graph, 
  a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. 
  A single graph can have many different spanning trees. 
  A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph 
  is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
  The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.
  
  * How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has? 
    -> A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.
